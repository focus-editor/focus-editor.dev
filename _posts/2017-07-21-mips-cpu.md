For those who want to know how the CPU works, there's an excellent set of lectures available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhwVAYxlh5dvB1MkZrcRZy6x_a2yORNAu) courtesy of the Bilkent University (Turkey). Sure, not every course or book clicks with everyone, but personally I find that one extremely clear and well explained, so highly recommend to go and check it out if you're interested.

### Why Computer organisation courses like to use MIPS as their target architecture

Because this is probably the most consistent, minimalistic, and clean RISC architecture available, which means it's easier to explain the core concepts of the CPU design without having to be distracted on irrelevant minutiae that do not contribute to the general understanding of the subject. (I cannot imagine what the course would look like if it were to use x86 as an example)

### Course assignments

The course above is the standard CS-224 Computer Organization course, which includes two assignments:

1. Project #1. MIPS Assembly programming
2. Project #2. Single-Cycle Processor design

The first project is simple and there's not much to talk about, but the second one is interesting, because you are asked to design a CPU that implements a subset of standard MIPS instructions as well as some additional ones (the practical usefulness of which is dubious, but which are great for learning) and then model it using Verilog.

I have completed both projects and found them very rewarding in terms of my understanding of computer hardware. If you decide to do them too and get stuck, feel free to ask me.

### A CPU in Verilog

Here's my code [on GitHub](https://github.com/obiwanus/mips-single-cycle) that implements the CPU as per the Project #2 assignment. It includes a simple assembler for all the instructions below, as well as [Verilog testbenches for each](https://github.com/obiwanus/mips-single-cycle/tree/master/processor/tests/instructions).

### What's next

I'm happy to help anyone who's studying CPU design if I can - just drop me a message.

When I have more free time for a project I will probably add pipelining to the CPU above, which should be interesting.
