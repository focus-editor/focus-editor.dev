About a year ago I decided to give C++ another shot, mainly because I am interested in
graphics programming and gamedev and it is still the most widely used language for these
purposes.

I used C++ to write a ray tracer (see previous post) and then started going through the
Effective C++ series by S. Meyers. It didn't take me too long to realise that I didn't want
to continue. Below is a screenshot from the notes I made while studying:

The reasons I decided to stop are:

* C++ is a tool that you can use to make amazing stuff, but it's a tool with so many
  footguns attached that you need to read a few books dedicated entirely to avoiding
  the language's pitfalls to be able to use it.

* C++ is _huge_. To reach a level where I'd be comfortable I'd need to spend _a ton_ of
  time learning and programming in it, which is a very significant investment.

* I highly doubt the language has a future, given the direction the C++ committee has
  chosen for it.

* Many programmers feel miserable when using C++ and want to drop it but keep using it
  because of inertia

So, I reckoned that the investment was not worth my time, and checked out Go and Rust instead.
I liked all the ideas behind Go, but decided to start seriously learning Rust because it
better aligns with my personal interests.
